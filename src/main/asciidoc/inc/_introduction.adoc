= Spring Cloud Samples: Brewery on OpenShift

== Overview

This guides walks you through to setup  https://github.com/kameshsampath/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery] on
https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift].  The steps in this guide could be a the first step or a Proof of Technology(PoT)
on how to migrate the existing Spring Cloud/Boot applications on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].

In the process of migration, the original https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
will be modified to make it deployable on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].

The application will be migrated with iterations,

* [*] <<iteration-1>> - As-is deployment of the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
with minimal or no code change

* [*] <<iteration-2>> - Will strip deployment of few Netflix OSS components that is considered as superfluous inside Kubernetes

* [] Iteration III - Optimization

* [] Iteration IV - Serviec Mesh

== Pre-Requsite

You have a OpenShift cluster running locally using https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[*minishift*]
or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/Op[*CDK*], or
have access to https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html[*OpenShift Container Platform*]

[NOTE]
====

This is needed only in OpenShift and applicable for iteations 2 and above

`oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default -n $(oc project -q)`
====

== Accessing the Applications

You can view the application urls from OpenShift Web Console.  A successful deployment  will have all the applications running with single pod. The following screenshots
shows how the <<deploy-eureka,Eureka>> will look like when all the clients registers with it
